Objective: Develop a full-featured, scalable mobile app that leverages AI image generation, includes a powerful gallery system (personal & public), integrates with PayPal for payments, and provides a premium user experience suitable for immediate launch on the Google Play Store.

üé® 1. AI-Powered Image Generation
Core Features:
Integration with Open-Source Models: Use Hugging Face's Stable Diffusion, SDXL, and Anything-V5 for high-quality image generation.

Prompt-to-Image Generation:

Users input a custom text prompt.

They can choose from predefined styles (e.g., realistic, fantasy, portrait, cyberpunk, anime, watercolor, etc.).

Optional reference image upload for style matching.

Advanced Features:

Inpainting: Fill missing sections of images with user-defined context.

Upscaling: Provide options to upscale generated images for higher resolution.

Post-Processing Filters: Apply style transfer, background blurring, or face enhancement filters for image refinement.

üñºÔ∏è 2. AI Image Gallery System (Public & Personal)
Personal Gallery:
Save & Organize Creations:

Users store generated images in their private gallery.

Allow users to create custom collections (e.g., ‚ÄúLandscapes‚Äù, ‚ÄúPortraits‚Äù, ‚ÄúConcept Art‚Äù).

Enable image sorting and filtering based on tags, date, or style.

Favorite/Like images and add descriptive tags to personalize them further.

Download, share on social media, or directly email their creations.

Public Gallery:
Community Showcase:

Feature a public gallery for users who opt to share their creations.

Allow likes, comments, and sharing to create an interactive space for creativity.

Include filters like Trending, Newest, Most Liked, and Featured for easy navigation.

Users can view prompts used to generate images and inspire others.

üí≥ 3. PayPal Payment Integration
Payment Options:
PayPal API Integration: Enable users to purchase credits for additional generations or unlock premium features (e.g., HD images, unlimited generations).

One-Time Purchases: Offer credit packs (e.g., 10 credits for $5).

Subscription Plans:

Monthly or yearly plans for unlimited access to image generation.

Option to choose between basic (limited generations) and premium (unlimited with extra benefits).

Secure Payment Flow:

Implement PayPal Smart Payment Buttons for easy transaction flow.

Use webhooks to handle real-time subscription and payment status updates.

Ensure secure storage of transaction data and end-to-end encryption.

üîê 4. User Authentication & Security
Multi-Method Sign-Up/Sign-In:

Gmail OAuth 2.0 login for seamless account creation.

Manual email/password registration with email verification.

Session Management:

Implement JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure session handling.

Include password recovery, two-factor authentication (optional), and multi-device sync.

üíé 5. UI/UX Design & User Experience
Design Philosophy:
Elegant, Modern, and Intuitive: The UI should be sleek and premium with smooth animations and micro-interactions.

Mobile-First Design: Create a design suitable for small screens, focusing on minimalism and efficiency.

Dark/Light Mode: Include a toggle for dark and light themes to enhance user comfort.

Fluid Navigation:

Home Screen: Present an easy-to-use interface where users can quickly create, save, and browse AI-generated images.

Gallery: Display images in a grid or carousel with options to filter by category, tag, or popularity.

Profile: A section for viewing purchased credits, subscription status, and managing preferences.

Settings: Enable language preferences, payment methods, and account management.

Performance: Ensure fast loading times and minimal app size for smooth user experiences.

‚öôÔ∏è 6. Backend Architecture & Infrastructure
Technology Stack:
Backend: Use Node.js or Python with FastAPI for handling image generation requests, user authentication, and payment management.

Database: Use Firebase Firestore or Supabase for real-time user data storage (image history, preferences, and gallery data).

Storage: Host images on AWS S3 or Google Cloud Storage for scalable and secure file storage.

Image Generation: Leverage Hugging Face or Replicate for model inference or self-host a local model with GPU support for faster processing.

Push Notifications: Integrate Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) for alerts on successful image generation, payment confirmations, or new gallery features.

üìÇ 7. Code & Deliverables
Frontend: React Native (or Flutter) for cross-platform development with platform-specific optimizations.

Backend: Node.js/Express or FastAPI for RESTful API communication.

Image Generation: Integration with Hugging Face‚Äôs Inference API or self-hosted models.

Security: Ensure robust user authentication and transaction handling (PayPal integration, OAuth 2.0).

Documentation:

Source Code: Organized structure for easy maintenance and future updates.

API Documentation: Clear instructions for backend and frontend communication.

Deployment Guide: Instructions for deploying backend, connecting to payment gateways, and deploying the app on the Play Store.
